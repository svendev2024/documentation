Create quotations
=================

In Odoo *Sales* quotations can be quickly created and sent to customers. Once a quotation has been
confirmed, it officially turns into a *sales order*, which can then be invoiced and paid for.

Quotation settings
==================

While the ability to create and send quotations in the Odoo *Sales* application is avaialble, by
default, there are a collection of quotation and order settings that can be customized and
configured, if needed.

To access these setting options, navigate to :menuselection:`Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings`, and scroll to the :guilabel:`Quotations & Orders` section.

  Providers` page, as well. To learn more, refer to the :doc:`Online payment order confirmation
  <get_paid_to_validate>` documentation.

:guilabel:`Save`.

Quotations dashboard
====================

To access the *Quotations* dashboard, which is the default dashboard of the *Sales* app, simply
click the :menuselection:`Sales app` from the main Odoo dashbord.

.. tip::
   If already in the *Sales* application, the :guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard can be accessed by
   navigating to :menuselection:`Orders --> Quotations` from the header menu in the *Sales*
   application.

By default, the :guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard displays all the quotations in the database that
are related to the current user, as indicated by the default :guilabel:`My Quotations` filter
present in the :guilabel:`Search...` bar.

.. image:: create_quotations/quotations-dashboard.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Quotations dashboard present in the Odoo Sales application.

.. note::
   To view *all* quotations in the database, remove the :guilabel:`My Quotations` filter from the
   :guilabel:`Search...` bar.

Quotations on this page appear in a default list view, but can also be viewed in a
:icon:`oi-view-kanban` :guilabel:`Kanban` view, :icon:`fa-calendar` :guilabel:`Calendar`,
:icon:`oi-view-pivot` :guilabel:`Pivot` table, :icon:`fa-area-chart` :guilabel:`Graph`, or
:icon:`fa-clock-o` :guilabel:`Activity` view.

To view and/or modify any listed quotation from the :guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard, simply click
on the desired quotation line from the list, and Odoo reveals the specific form for that selected
quotation.

Create quotation
================

To create a quotation in the Odoo *Sales* application, open the :menuselection:`Sales app`, and
click the :guilabel:`New` button, located in the upper-left corner of the main
:guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`New` button is **only** present if the :guilabel:`Quotations` dashboard is in list
   or Kanban view.

Clicking the :guilabel:`New` button reveals a blank quotation form, with various fields and tabs to
configure.

.. image:: create_quotations/quotation-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A typical quotation form in the Odoo Sales application.

Begin by entering the customer's name in the :guilabel:`Customer` field at the top of the form. This
is a **required** field.

If the customer's information is already in the database, the :guilabel:`Invoice Address` and
:guilabel:`Delivery Address` fields auto-populate with the saved information for those respective
fields, based on the data from that customer's contact record (found in the *Contacts* application).

If the customer was referred by another customer or contact, enter their name in the
:guilabel:`Referrer` field.

If a :guilabel:`Referrer` is selected, a new field, :guilabel:`Commission Plan` appears, in which
a commission can be selected from the drop-down menu that would be rewarded to the contact selected
in the :guilabel:`Referrer` field.

Next, if they have not already been auto-populated with the customer's information, enter the
appropriate addresses in the :guilabel:`Invoice Address` and :guilabel:`Delivery Address` fields.
Both of these fields are **required**.

Then, if desired, choose a :guilabel:`Quotation Template` from the drop-down field to apply to this
quotation.

The date that appears, by default, in the :guilabel:`Expiration` field is based on the number
configured in the :guilabel:`Default Quotation Validity` setting (in :menuselection:`Sales app -->
Configuration --> Settings`).

.. tip::
   When using a quotation template, the date in the :guilabel:`Expiration` field is based off the
   :guilabel:`Quotation Validity` figure on the template form.

If this quotation for a recurring product or subscription, select the desired :guilabel:`Recurring
Plan` from that specific drop-down menu.

If desired, select a specific :guilabel:`Pricelist` to be applied to this quotation.

Lastly, select any specific :guilabel:`Payment Terms` to be used for this quotation.

Order Lines tab
---------------

The first tab on the quotation form is the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab.

In this tab, select products, and quantities of those products, to add them to the quotation.

There are two ways to add products to the quotation from this tab.

Clicking :guilabel:`Add a product`, selecting the desired item from the :guilabel:`Product`
drop-down field, and proceeding to adjust the quantity of that selected product, if necessary, is
one way to add products to a quotation.

Or, click :guilabel:`Catalog` to reveal a separate page, showcasing every item (and every potential
product variant) in a neatly organized display, with items organziable by :guilabel:`Product
Category` and :guilabel:`Attributes`.

.. image:: create_quotations/product-catalog.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A product catalog accessible via a quotation in the Odoo Sales application.

From here, simply locate the desired items, click the :icon:`fa-shopping-cart` :guilabel:`Add`
button on the product card(s), and adjust the quantity, if needed. When complete, click the
:guilabel:`Back to Quotation` button in the upper-left corner to return to the quotation, where the
newly-selected catalog items can be found in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab.

If multiple items should be presented in a more organized way on the quotation, click :guilabel:`Add
a section`, enter a name for the section, and drag-and-drop that section heading in the desired
location amongst the items in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab. The section heading appears in bold.

If needed, click :guilabel:`Add a note` beneath a certain product line, to add a custom note about
that specific product. The note appears in italics.

Beneath the product lines, there are buttons that can be clicked to apply any of the following:
:guilabel:`Coupon Code`, :guilabel:`Promotions`, :guilabel:`Discount`, and/or :guilabel:`Add
shipping`.

Optional Products tab
---------------------

Open the :guilabel:`Optional Products` tab to select related products that can be presented to the
customer, which may result in an increased sale. For example, if the customer wants to buy a car, an
optional product that could be offered is a *Trailer Hitch*.

:doc:`Optional products <optional_products>` documentation.

Other Info tab

In the :guilabel:`Other Info` tab, there are various quotation-related configurations separated into

Sending and confirming quotations
=================================

Once all the necessary fields and tabs have been configured on the quotation form, it is time to
send the quotation to the customer, so they can confirm it, which subsequently, turns the quotation
into an official sales order.

At the top of the form, there is a series of buttons:

- :guilabel:`Send by Email`: when clicked, a pop-up window appears with the customer's name and
  email address in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, the quotation (and reference ID) in the
  :guilabel:`Subject` field, and a brief default message in the body of the email, which can be
  modified, if needed.

  Below that, a PDF copy of the quotation is attached. When ready, click :guilabel:`Send` to send
  the quotation, via email, to the customer, so they can review and confirm it.
- :guilabel:`Send PRO-FORMA Invoice`: this button **only** appears if the *Pro-Forma Invoice*
  setting has been enabled. When clicked, a pop-up window appears with the customer's name and email
  address in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, the *Proforma* invoice (and reference ID) in the
  :guilabel:`Subject` field, and a brief default message in the body of the email, which can be
  modified, if needed.

  Below that, a PDF copy of the quotation is attached. When ready, click :guilabel:`Send` to send
  the quotation, via email, to the customer, so they can review and confirm it.
- :guilabel:`Confirm`: when clicked, the quotation is confirmed, and the status changes to
  :guilabel:`Sales Order`.

  when they log into their customer portal. Click the :icon:`fa-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Back to edit
  mode` link at the top of the preview page, in the blue banner, to return to the quotation form.
- :guilabel:`Cancel`: when clicked, the quotation is canceled.

   Once a quotation is confirmed, it officially becomes a sales order. If the *Lock Confirmed Sales*
   setting is enabled, the sales order becomes :guilabel:`Locked`, and is indicated as such on the
   sales order form.

At this point, the quotation has been confirmed, turned into a sales order, and is now ready to be
invoiced and paid for. For more information about invoicing, refer to the :doc:`Invoice based on
