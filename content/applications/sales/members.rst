Then click :guilabel:`Create`. In the :guilabel:`Edit` toolbar on the far right of the page, click
:guilabel:`Save`.

Return to :menuselection:`CRM app --> Sales --> Customers` and click the Kanban card for a member.
Click the :guilabel:`Go to Website` smart button at the top of the page to open the partner's
webpage.

After making any necessary changes to the page, click :guilabel:`Save`. At the top of the page,
